      <description>I really loved lodash. It brough the joy of compact functional code to JavaScript. Especially 6 years ago when I first embraced it. It was a wonderful library. Back then, there was no ES6, no Babel, and terrible browser incompatabilities ran rampant. Lodash along with jQuery were the saving light of that time.
I gravitated towards using Lodash because the first language I learned was Scheme. It had functional programing at it&amp;rsquo;s core, and highly influanced how I think about code to this day.</description>
