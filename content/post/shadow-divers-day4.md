# John Chatterton

A man on an endless quest of self exploration. John Chatterton didn't follow other advice. Instead, he followed his own path. He chose to get answers through experience in the army, volunteering for Vietnam, and becoming a commercial diver.

In all his endeavors, he gave everything and learned every detail. An attitude like this lead to him becomes great at his vocation.

Taking on the tasks no one likes, giving everything to every job, and learning the smallest detail are the values of a great professional.
